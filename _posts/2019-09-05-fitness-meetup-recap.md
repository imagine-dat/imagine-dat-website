Our second meetup is in the books and our data visualization enthusiasts community keeps growing! We had such a great time meeting new members, sharing ideas, discussing projects, and chatting about the future of Imagine.Dat.

Some of the ideas that came out of this meetup were to get together in between challenges to work on our data visualization projects, ask questions, and share mentoring. In addition, we talked about sharing more tutorial posts and maybe set up some workshops. Our goal is to create a community that helps each other learn about data visualization and the different technologies available to represent our data.

Ren and Milu took different approaches to represent this month’s fitness theme challenge.

Milu is a bodybuilder and was curious to see the number of calories she spends in a day. Using the QS app, she was able to gather her resting and active caloric expenditure for the past two months as a CSV file. The technologies she used for this challenge were ReactJS and Chart.js. By putting together this data visualization representation she learned that her average caloric expenditure is a lot higher than the one of a female of the same age and height. In other words, Milu learned that she can eat a lot more calories thanks to her hours in the lifting room. You can check out her data visualization [here](https://damp-plateau-35251.herokuapp.com/).

Ren is a runner and recently came out of injury.  She took the data that she exported to CSV files from the Strava app to explore her mileage and time spent per activity while also looking at the difference between the activities.  She used React Vis to visualize her data, which is a fairly easy plugin while building a react app, but a bit confusing for getting the data in how you want it.

It was interesting for us to explore fitness, because it has such a presence in some many peoples’ lives as well as ours, so while Ren and Milu took fairly personal explorations on the data theme, the fact is that the data for fitness is so vast they could have taken easily taken a more community based approach.
